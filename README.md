### Hello, World! ðŸŒŽ 

My name is Jeferson and I'm a passionate software developer with a degree in Computer Science.

I have been working as a Software Developer for the past nine years. Since then, I have already worked for several technology companies in various industries. I'm always open minded and eager to learn new methodologies and technologies.

In my spare time you will find me wandering through the beautiful landscapes around Rio de Janeiro, hanging out with my wife or playing with our dog.
